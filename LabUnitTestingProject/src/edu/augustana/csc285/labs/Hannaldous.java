// Supervisor's note: Here's the smelly code that Hannaldous left us...
//
// In this order, please:
//  First, try to figure out what each method DOES by reading the code 
//     and methodically testing each method (from main).
//  Second, create a HannaldousTest class with a series of unit tests
//     that carefully test ALL the methods inside Hannaldous
//     that test the full range of behavior (including corner cases)
//  Third, refactor this code to make it as elegant as possible!
//      After each change, run your suite of unit tests to make sure
//      that all tests still pass!
//  Fourth, include a proper Javadoc comment for the public method 
//         (see Skrien appendix B, pp 318-331)
//   
//  NOTE: You should leave the class name (Hannaldous) the same, 
//       but methods should be renamed, parameters improved, etc...
//
//  HINT: the post-increment operator (e.g. i++) is weirder than you knew
//         (read Skrien appendix B, pp 318-331)
